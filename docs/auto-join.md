user: "another question on the lounge: 

the current way we call the lounge is via a link like this:

http://our-host-url/?password=uDbZ0Hqo7KL0o71TSnvh&autoconnect=true&nick=anonymous_9692ab&username=anonymous_9692ab%2Fcommonground&realname=anonymous_9692ab&join=%23florilicious&lockchannel=true&nofocus=true&theme=dark&mode=single

we forked the lounge and built in an autoconnect feature that's why we have the query param for that

but the issue is witht he join command: it makes the user join the channel, but not "switch" to it if they've been logged in before and were in another channel - that one will stick

which param (if any exists) can we send that will make the user not only join but also switch to that channel? "




ai: "Short answer: there isn’t a built‑in query param in stock The Lounge to “switch focus” to a channel. The only officially supported URL overrides are the connect‑form fields (e.g., nick, username, password, join/channels, etc.) and nothing for active channel selection. Those overrides are documented and limited to public‑mode behavior.  ￼

However, you can get exactly what you want in your fork with one of the two approaches below.

⸻

Option A (recommended): trigger the built‑in focus‑on‑join path

The Lounge focuses a channel when you execute the /join command (this was added years ago: “Focus a channel by joining it”). If you programmatically run /join after autoconnect, you get focus for free. Use the Public Client API from a tiny plugin (or directly in your fork) to run the command once the network is connected.  ￼ ￼

Minimal plugin (client‑side) sketch

// packages/thelounge-plugin-autofocus/index.js
module.exports = (client) => {
  // read ?focus or ?open or reuse ?join
  const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  const wanted = params.get("focus") || params.get("open") || params.get("join");
  if (!wanted) return;

  // normalize channel name
  const chanName = wanted.startsWith("#") ? wanted : `#${wanted}`;

  // wait until at least one network lobby is present
  const wait = (cond) => new Promise((r) => {
    const id = setInterval(() => { if (cond()) { clearInterval(id); r(); } }, 50);
  });

  wait(() => client.networks && client.networks.length > 0).then(() => {
    // pick the first network's lobby (any joined channel id is fine as a source)
    const lobby = client.networks[0].channels.find(c => c.type === "LOBBY") || client.networks[0].channels[0];

    // This uses the same path as a user typing /join in the input box,
    // which makes The Lounge switch focus to the newly joined channel
    client.runAsUser(`JOIN ${chanName}`, lobby.id);
  });
};

Why this works
	•	The “focus on /join” behavior is in upstream; you’re just reusing it.  ￼
	•	The Public Client API officially exposes runAsUser() for exactly this sort of thing.  ￼

Integration tip: since you already added autoconnect=true in your fork, just ship this as a local plugin and parse a param like focus=#florilicious. If you prefer not to add a new param, reuse your existing join value to also set focus.

⸻

Option B: add a “focus” param that drives the router/UI

If you’d rather not rely on /join semantics, you can add a tiny client patch that, after sync, finds the target channel by name and asks the UI to open it. (This is internal/UI‑level logic, not an upstream API.)

Sketch of what to do in your fork
	1.	On boot, parse ?focus= from location.search.
	2.	Wait for channel list to load (e.g., poll client.networks until connected).
	3.	Find the channel object whose .name.toLowerCase() matches.
	4.	Navigate to it via the app router/store (in your fork), e.g. app.$router.push({ name: 'chan', params: { id: chan.id } }).

Caveats: The specific router/store calls are internal and not documented; they may change across upstream upgrades. Option A is more future‑proof because it uses the supported Public Client API. (Note: The docs mention The Lounge moved to Vue Router hash URLs like /#/…; there is no documented deep link for a specific channel, so avoid relying on hash shape.)  ￼

⸻

Why “just a param” doesn’t exist upstream

The only documented URL keys are for pre‑filling the connect form in public mode (name, host, nick, join, etc.). There’s no “active channel” param. After login (private mode), The Lounge restores prior state, so your param is ignored unless you add custom behavior like the plugin/patch above.  ￼

⸻

TL;DR for your Cursor agent
	•	No upstream ?focus/?active param exists. Only connect‑form overrides are supported.  ￼
	•	Implement Option A: install a tiny plugin that reads ?focus and calls publicClient.runAsUser('JOIN #chan', lobbyId) after connect. This uses upstream’s “focus on join” behavior.  ￼ ￼
	•	If you prefer, Option B: add router/store logic in your fork to switch the active channel by id after sync (less stable across upgrades).
	•	Keep your existing params (autoconnect, lockchannel, nofocus, theme, etc.) as‑is; just add focus=<channel> (or reuse join) and wire up the plugin."



user: "so what purpose does this channel name have i already attach? i notice that the correct channel is always in the sidebar but again, when the user was logged in at an earlier time, thus has a history of some kind, they will open in the previous channel, with the new channel that was in our query param now in the sidebar. doesnt that mean thelounge is "joining" that channel und why is that not ccausing the focus? i ask this since this makes me doubt your statement that doing it via another join we bolt on would now solve it. am i misunderstanding you? the second option you presented makes sense, i.e. on the ui level"



ai: "You’re not wrong—The Lounge is joining that channel (hence it appears in the sidebar), but it’s not switching focus because of how state restore and “join” handling work.

Here’s what’s going on and how to fix it.

⸻

Why it joins but doesn’t focus
  1.  Private‑mode state restore wins.
In private mode, The Lounge intentionally restores the last active channel when you reconnect (“Synchronized experience. Always resume where you left off.”). That restore runs before/independent of any URL overrides. So even if you auto‑join #florilicious, TL will land you back on “the place you left off” unless you explicitly tell the UI to change.  ￼
  2.  URL ?join= is for pre‑filling connection in public mode.
The documented URL overrides (including join) only pre‑load/connect; they don’t include a param for “active channel”. That’s by design.  ￼
  3.  “Focus on join” only triggers on a user‑initiated JOIN.
Upstream added “Focus a channel by joining it” in the user command path (typing /join #chan), not when channels are auto‑joined by config/URL at connect time. So your autoconnected join doesn’t flip focus.  ￼

One more thing: your example URL includes lockchannel=true. If your fork implemented that literally (“don’t change active channel”), then it will explicitly block focus changes—remove or override it for this flow.

⸻

What will work reliably

Option 1 — UI‑level focus (most deterministic)

Since you control a fork, add a tiny client hook that, after sync, opens the target channel by name.

Where: your autoconnect code path (client side), after networks/channels are loaded.
Logic:
  1.  Parse focus (or reuse first join) from location.search.
  2.  Wait until client.networks are present.
  3.  If the channel already exists, activate it via the router/store (the same code path as when a user clicks in the sidebar).
  4.  If it doesn’t exist yet, issue a JOIN and then activate when it appears.

Minimal sketch (inside your fork/plugin):

module.exports = (client) => {
  const p = new URLSearchParams(location.search);
  const raw = p.get("focus") || (p.get("join") || "").split(",")[0];
  if (!raw) return;

  const want = raw.startsWith("#") ? raw : `#${raw}`;
  const wait = (cond, fn) => {
    const id = setInterval(() => { if (cond()) { clearInterval(id); fn(); } }, 50);
  };

  wait(() => (client.networks?.length || 0) > 0, () => {
    const nets = client.networks;
    // find channel by name across networks (adjust if you only have one)
    let chan, net;
    for (const n of nets) {
      chan = n.channels?.find(c => (c.name || "").toLowerCase() === want.toLowerCase());
      if (chan) { net = n; break; }
    }

    if (chan) {
      // 👇 use the same UI path as clicking a channel
      // Depending on your fork, this can be:
      //   app.$router.push({ name: "chan", params: { id: chan.id } })
      // or simulate a click:
      const node = document.querySelector(`[data-id="${chan.id}"] a`);
      if (node) node.click();
      return;
    }

    // Not joined yet: issue a user-style JOIN (see Option 2)
    const lobby = nets[0].channels.find(c => c.type === "LOBBY") || nets[0].channels[0];
    client.runAsUser(`JOIN ${want}`, lobby.id);  // focus will follow when JOIN event arrives
  });
};

Why this is best: it works whether the channel is already joined or not, and it doesn’t depend on server numerics or timing quirks.

Option 2 — User‑style /JOIN after connect (works if not already joined)

Use the Public Client API to simulate a /JOIN after the connection is up:

client.runAsUser(`JOIN ${want}`, lobbyId);

That path does switch focus when a real JOIN happens (it uses the user-command code path). But if the user is already in the channel, the server replies “already on channel”, and no focus change occurs. That’s why Option 1 includes a pre‑check and only falls back to /JOIN when needed.  ￼

⸻

TL;DR
  • You’re seeing the correct behavior: join ≠ focus during state restore.
  • A second /JOIN isn’t guaranteed to fix focus if the user is already in the channel; that’s why you had doubts (good instinct).
  • Implement a tiny UI‑level “focus” hook (Option 1). It’s the simplest, deterministic fix.
  • Also double‑check your custom lockchannel=true isn’t suppressing channel switching in your fork.

Docs for reference: URL overrides list (no focus param) and Public Client API (runAsUser).  ￼

If you want, I can tailor this into a drop‑in plugin file for your fork and wire it to a ?focus=#channel param, with a guard to ignore it when lockchannel=true is present."




user: "explain to me cursor ai agent how to build that plugin. give them all information they need"



ai: "Awesome—here’s a concrete, “copy/paste-ready” set of instructions you can hand to your Cursor AI agent to build a micro‑plugin for The Lounge that lets you programmatically focus a target channel after login/auto‑connect.

Why a plugin + tiny client hook?
The Lounge’s server plugin API can send custom events to the browser but it can’t directly change the UI focus. We’ll:
	1.	add a server plugin that exposes /focus and can emit a “focus this channel” event to the browser, and
	2.	add a 10‑line client listener in your fork that receives that event and switches the active channel.
This uses the documented Commands API and Public Client API (sendToBrowser, runAsUser, etc.).  ￼

⸻

0) What we’ll build
	•	Plugin package: thelounge-plugin-focus-channel
	•	Registers a /focus command.
	•	Also provides a helper /focus-join <#chan> that joins a channel (if needed) then focuses it.
	•	Uses client.sendToBrowser('cg:focus-channel', {name}) to ask the browser to switch focus.  ￼
	•	Client hook (in your fork):
	•	Listens for the cg:focus-channel socket event, finds/creates the channel in the client store, then navigates to it.

You already pass ?join=%23foo etc.; keep that. If the user has prior state, The Lounge will reopen the last active channel; our hook will override that once as soon as we get the focus event.

module.exports = {
  onServerStart(thelounge) {
    // 1) /focus #channel  -> just focus an already-joined channel
    thelounge.Commands.add("focus", {
      allowDisconnected: true,        // can run before the network is fully connected if you want
      input(client, target, cmd, args) {

        }
        const name = normalizeChannel(raw);
        client.sendToBrowser("cg:focus-channel", { name }); // <-- triggers browser to switch
      },
    });

    // 2) /focus-join #channel  -> join then focus (if parted)
    thelounge.Commands.add("focus-join", {
      allowDisconnected: true,
      input(client, target, cmd, args) {
        const raw = args.join(" ").trim();
        if (!raw) {
          client.sendMessage("Usage: /focus-join #channel", target.chan);
          return;
        }
        const name = normalizeChannel(raw);

        // Find the lobby target id for runAsUser replies (fall back to current target)
        const firstNet = client.networks[0];
        const lobby = firstNet?.channels?.find(ch => ch.type === "LOBBY") || target.chan;
        const targetId = String(lobby?.id ?? target.chan.id);

        // If not present or PARTED, JOIN, then ask client to focus
        const existing = firstNet?.channels?.find(ch => ch.name?.toLowerCase() === name.toLowerCase());
        if (!existing || existing.state === "PARTED") {
          client.runAsUser(`JOIN ${name}`, targetId); // JOIN via Public Client API
        }

        // Tell browser to focus (it will wait until the chan exists)
        client.sendToBrowser("cg:focus-channel", { name });
      },
    });

    function normalizeChannel(s) {
      // accept "#foo", "foo", "%23foo" etc.
      try { s = decodeURIComponent(s); } catch (e) {}
      s = s.trim();
      if (!s.startsWith("#") && !s.startsWith("&") && !s.startsWith("+")) s = "#" + s;
      return s;
    }
  },
};

	•	Commands.add registers new slash commands; the input(client, target, cmd, args) signature is documented.  ￼
	•	client.runAsUser("JOIN #chan", targetId) issues an IRC command as if the user typed it.  ￼
	•	client.sendToBrowser(event, data) sends a custom event to your browser code.  ￼

Install the plugin locally (during dev)

# From the machine where The Lounge runs
thelounge install file:/ABSOLUTE/PATH/to/thelounge-plugin-focus-channel
# or run this inside your Docker container

The Lounge supports installing local packages via file:.  ￼

Note: The Lounge API is marked as not final and can change—keep this plugin tiny and pinned to a known The Lounge version.  ￼

⸻

2) Add a 10‑line client hook (your fork)

In your fork (Vue client), register a socket listener once during app bootstrap.

Where to put it
Add a tiny module (e.g., client/js/cg-focus-hook.ts) and import it from the same place other socket event modules are wired (look for where socket.on(...) handlers are registered—typically the “socket events” index).

cg-focus-hook.ts (example)

import socket from "../js/socket";        // same socket import used elsewhere
import store from "../js/store";          // vuex store
import router from "../js/router";        // vue-router

// Receive the server plugin event and switch the active channel.
socket.on("cg:focus-channel", async ({ name }: { name: string }) => {
  if (!name) return;
  // Find channel by name across networks
  const networks = store.state.networks || [];
  let chan = null;

  for (const net of networks) {
    chan = (net.channels || []).find((c: any) => (c.name || "").toLowerCase() === name.toLowerCase());
    if (chan) break;
  }

  // If the channel isn't in the store yet (e.g., JOIN is still in flight),
  // poll briefly; this runs only once per focus request.
  const waitFor = async (ms: number) => new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, ms));
  let retries = 20; // ~2s
  while (!chan && retries-- > 0) {
    await waitFor(100);
    for (const net of (store.state.networks || [])) {
      chan = (net.channels || []).find((c: any) => (c.name || "").toLowerCase() === name.toLowerCase());
      if (chan) break;
    }
  }

  if (!chan) return; // give up quietly

  // Navigate to the channel; The Lounge’s router exposes a route per channel id.
  router.push({ name: "chan", params: { id: String(chan.id) } });
});

The client piece is minimal: listen to cg:focus-channel and route to /chan/:id (how The Lounge identifies channels in the UI). Programmatic navigation is standard Vue Router usage.  ￼

⸻

3) Wire it to your existing URL flow (no new query params required)

You already open The Lounge with something like:

.../thelounge/?autoconnect=true&join=%23florilicious&lockchannel=true...

Add one line in your fork to automatically fire the plugin command right after you parse query params and issue your autoconnect logic:

// after your existing autoconnect/join parsing in your fork
const focusCandidate = getQueryParam("join") || getQueryParam("focus") || null;
if (focusCandidate) {
  // Just tell the plugin to focus (and join if needed)
  socket.emit("input", { // shape matches what the input box sends
    target: getCurrentTargetIdFromStore(), // current channel id; any valid id works
    text: `/focus-join ${focusCandidate}`
  });
}

	•	This reuses your join param as the focus target.
	•	The plugin will JOIN (if needed) and then send the browser focus event.

If you prefer zero client emits, you can instead trigger sendToBrowser directly from the plugin on connect—but the public docs don’t expose a “client connected” hook. The /focus(-join) route above is the least invasive & documented path using Commands + Public Client APIs.  ￼

⸻

4) Docker/Railway notes (installing the plugin in images)

Dockerfile (example)

FROM ghcr.io/thelounge/thelounge:4.4.3

# Copy the plugin source into the image
COPY thelounge-plugin-focus-channel /opt/tl-plugins/focus-channel

# Install it into THELOUNGE_HOME
# Thelounge CLI must run as the same user (the image uses the "node" user)
USER node
RUN thelounge install file:/opt/tl-plugins/focus-channel

Thelounge CLI and local file: installs are the official way to add plugins.  ￼

Railway
	•	Build the image with the plugin baked in (as above) or run thelounge install file:/… as a post‑build step.
	•	No extra env needed.

⸻

5) Dev/test checklist
	•	Cold login: Open with ?autoconnect&join=%23general → should land in #general.
	•	Warm resume (was previously in #random): open same URL → should switch to #general within ~2s.
	•	Parted channel: open with ?join=%23new while not joined → plugin does JOIN then focuses it.
	•	Edge cases: focus without join, URL‑encoded names (%23foo.bar), multiple networks.

⸻

6) Security & stability
	•	This doesn’t expose any new server endpoints—only a plugin command visible to authenticated users.
	•	The event is local to the user session (client.sendToBrowser).  ￼
	•	The Lounge API is not finalized; keep the plugin isolated and pinned to a known version.  ￼

⸻

7) API references used
	•	Public Client API (runAsUser, sendToBrowser, createChannel, sendMessage) — The Lounge docs.  ￼
	•	Commands API (Commands.add, input(client, target, cmd, args)) — The Lounge docs.  ￼
	•	Installing local packages (thelounge install file:/path) — The Lounge docs.  ￼
	•	API stability note — The Lounge docs.  ￼

⸻

TL;DR for Cursor
	1.	Create thelounge-plugin-focus-channel with onServerStart, add /focus and /focus-join using client.sendToBrowser and client.runAsUser.
	2.	Install via thelounge install file:/path/to/plugin.
	3.	In the client fork, add a socket.on('cg:focus-channel', …) that finds the chan and router.push({ name:'chan', params:{ id }}).
	4.	After your existing autoconnect flow, auto‑emit /focus-join <joinParam> once.

That’s it—consistent, tiny, and fully documented by The Lounge’s plugin APIs."
